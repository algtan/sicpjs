// Newton's method for cube roots is based on the fact that if 'y' is an approximation to the
// cube root of 'x', then a better approximation is given by the value

// ((x/y^2) + 2*y) / 3

// Use this formula to implement a cube-root function analogous to the square-root function.
// (In section 1.3.4 we will see how to implement Newton's method in general as an
// abstraction of these square-root and cube-root functions.)
